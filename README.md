## About
I'm finishing a degree in cybersecurity and building hands-on projects that demonstrate networking, scripting, detection, and lab-forensics skills. This repo is an index of those projects and writeups.

## Projects (short list)
- **nmap-lab-scan** — Safe reconnaissance scripts and lab walkthrough. (projects/nmap-lab-scan)
- **elk-home-logging** — Dockerized ELK stack that ingests lab logs and shows dashboards. (projects/elk-home-logging)
- **detection-rules** — Sigma rules and Snort/Suricata examples used in my home lab. (projects/detection-rules)

## How to use this repo
Each project folder includes:
- `README.md` — project summary, lab topology, steps to reproduce
- `code/` — scripts, dockerfiles, configs
- `writeup.md` — lessons learned & resume-ready bullets
